[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/s8xeie2h882oqiih/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/parsd/wpf-state-machine-tutorial/branch/master)

This is an advanced tutorial on writing a classic Windows desktop app based on a state machine. While creating the app we will use a continuous integration pipeline which will be evolved to continuous delivery.

## Referenced Projects
The tutorial will use other projects/libraries:
### C# Libraries
* [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro) to help with the MVVM pattern
* [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) for testing
* [Stateless](https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless) to implement the state machine

### Tools
* [Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe) to link _Doxygen_ with _Sphinx_
* [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) to extract source code documentation for _Sphinx_/_Breathe_
* [Graphviz](https://github.com/ellson/graphviz) to visualize the state machine
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to create vector graphics for XAML
* [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) for coverage extraction
* [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml) to generate UML diagrams
* [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) to visualize _OpenCover_'s results
* [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx) for generating comprehensive documentation

and of course
